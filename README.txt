## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Created a project involving computers since I love the look and building one myself. I used html and chose semantic tags. I styled the CSS to match the computers. Javascript to manuever around the website

## Lessons Learned:

I was amazed I was able to organize the layout and how well it turned out

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
